# Useless Box

Basics:

- Servo Arm
- Servo Lid
- 4 x Servo Wheels
- LEDs

Sensors?

- Compass (for returning after spin move)
- IR Sensors
- Sonar Sensor

Other outputs?

- Secondary Arm
- Secondary Lid Mechanism
- Surrender Flag


I envision a state machine that gets increasingly chaotic involving

- normal moves
- fast moves
- slow moves
- jitter moves
- paused moves
